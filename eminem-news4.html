			<p>In honor of today’s 16th anniversary of the release of his seminal 
			<i>The Marshall Mathers LP</i>, Eminem is offering a series of limited-edition 
			collectible items that are now available at <a href="eminem-shop.html">shop.eminem.com</a>. 
			A portion of the proceeds from the sale of these items will be donated to the Marshall 
			Mathers Foundation, which provides funds for organizations working with at-risk 
			youth in Michigan and throughout the U.S.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The collectible items include an authentic brick from the rescued remains of 
			Eminem’s childhood home that was featured on the covers of <i>The Marshall Mathers LP</i> 
			and its sequel, 2013’s <i>The Marshall Mathers LP 2</i>. Each of the 700 bricks comes with a 
			numbered Certificate of Authenticity featuring Eminem’s handwritten signature, and a 
			display stand with enclosure that features a commemorative plaque on the side. All of 
			the bricks come in a sleek black packaging with custom artwork and a description of the 
			project. A cassette re-release of the iconic album featuring a 3-D motion printed cover 
			is also available. Finally, in collaboration with Brooklyn-based mill Good Wood, 
			Marshall Mathers dog tags created from re-purposed wood from Eminem’s childhood home 
			are available in extremely limited quantities.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Eminem’s <i>The Marshall Mathers LP</i> is a cornerstone of his celebrated body of 
			work. As his sophomore album, it cemented his identity as one of the most compelling 
			and unique artists of his time, which set him off on a career that still holds strong 
			today. While the the project was met with it’s share of controversy, there was an 
			underlying foundation of a very complex and honest personal story fittingly contained 
			within an album whose title carried his birth name, Marshall Mathers. Since its 
			release over 15 years ago, <i>MMLP</i> has been recognized by many as one of hip-hop’s 
			greatest albums.</p>
			<br>
			<p>In 2013, the album’s importance was reinforced when Eminem announced that his next	
			record would be titled <i>The Marshall Mathers LP 2</i>, which was labeled by the rapper as 
			more of a “revisitation” than a sequel. In comparing the two records, the 13-year 
			separation of their individual creation is apparent, but the deeply personal reflection 
			remains the same. A common anchor between the two albums can be symbolized in Mather’s 
			choice to feature his childhood home on both records’ cover art. The now iconic imagery 
			of the humble Detroit home symbolizes the honest, personal reflection that has been the 
			root of what has driven both Eminem’s music and the powerful connection to his fan base.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Ironically, during the same month of the release of <i>MMLP2</i> in 2013, the State of 
			Michigan ordered the house at 19946 Dresden Street to be knocked down due to structural 
			safety issues. By reacting quickly, Eminem and his team were able to salvage the brick 
			and wood materials from the home. From this, a painstakingly detailed process was started 
			to turn those raw materials into special, one-of-a-kind collectible items. These offerings 
			are a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Eminem fans to own a piece of Eminem history.</p>
